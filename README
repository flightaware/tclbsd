This package is a freely available open source package under the "Berkeley"
license, same as Tcl.  You can do virtually anything you like with it, such as 
modifying it, redistributing it, and selling it either in whole or in part.

USING THE BSD INTERFACE
=======================

package require BSD


BUGS

CONTENTS
========

Makefile.in	Makefile template.  The configure script uses this file to
		produce the final Makefile.

README		This file

aclocal.m4	Generated file.  Do not edit.  Autoconf uses this as input
		when generating the final configure script.  See "tcl.m4"
		below.

configure	Generated file.  Do not edit.  This must be regenerated
		anytime configure.in or tclconfig/tcl.m4 changes.

configure.in	Configure script template.  Autoconf uses this file as input
		to produce the final configure script.

generic/bsd.c	Tcl BSD interface source code
generic/tclbsd.c

generic/bsd.h	Header files for the BSD interface.


tclconfig/	This directory contains various template files that build
		the configure script.  They should not need modification.

	install-sh	Program used for copying binaries and script files
			to their install locations.

	tcl.m4		Collection of Tcl autoconf macros.  Included by
			aclocal.m4 to define SC_* macros.

UNIX BUILD
==========

Building under most UNIX systems is easy, just run the configure script
and then run make. 

	$ cd tclbsd
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

WINDOWS BUILD
=============

Probably irrelevant

INSTALLATION
============

The BSD interface package installs like so:

         $exec_prefix
          /       \
        lib       bin
         |         |
   PACKAGEx.y   (dependent .dll files on Windows)
         |
  pkgIndex.tcl (.so|.dll files)

The main .so|.dll library file gets installed in the versioned PACKAGE
directory, which is OK on all platforms because it will be directly
referenced with by 'load' in the pkgIndex.tcl file.  Dependent DLL files on
Windows must go in the bin directory (or other directory on the user's
PATH) in order for them to be found.
